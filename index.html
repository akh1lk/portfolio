        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a freshman, interested in backend development, 
            ML & AI. I currently work with Python, Java, and other
            associated backend/AI frameworks & languages such as SQL,
            Flask, and Node.js.

                <p>
                    "The Tinder for LinkedIn, swipe to network!" - This Tinder-LinkedIn that
                    makes networking addicting (and educational) was made for Cornell AppDev's 
                    Hack Challenge in Fall '24. I was the head backend developer of our 5-person
                    team, creating the backend using <strong>Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy</strong>.
                    We used <strong>AWS S3</strong> for image storing, and <strong>Firebase</strong>
                    for user authentication and messaging. 
                    
                    This experience gave me a strong experience with relational database building,
                    along with deploying an app, as we used <strong>Docker</strong> and Google Cloud Platform's 
                    <strong>Computer Engine</strong> to host the backend.

                <p>
                    Developed a **Java Swing GUI** image selection application featuring a variety of 
                    models for a class project. Implemented **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Priority Queues** 
                    for efficient pathfinding in the Intelligent Scissors Model. Added features like image 
                    selection, selection modification, saving, and keyboard shortcuts to enhance usability.
